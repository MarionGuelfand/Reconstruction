# Reconstruction

TREND_EAS:
Reconstruction code adapted for EAS (conic parametrisation in SWF)

TREND_background:
Reconstruction code that can be used for EAS and background (airplanes....)
For SWF, the scan is done on cartesian coordinates and don't use the conic parametrisation
So it should be slower
